 * the time is right, it will emit its own _INCREMENT_ action via `put(increment())`.

 * creator.

 * fundamental thinking over, because I don't want to drift too far away from
 * the pattern where the REDUCERS have 100% of the business logic.

 * side effect concern. It might get resolved purely locally, without any kind
 * of heavyweight async operation like a network call. But it's still worth

 * reducer somewhere. Keep the reducers focused on their own pure state logic,
